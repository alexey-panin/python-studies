    "The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a database of all of the values of time zone offsets. IANA also releases regular updates that include any changes in time zone offsets. The database contains a copy of all the designated time zones and how many hours and minutes they’re offset from UTC.\n",

    "## ISO 8601\n",
    "\n",
    "To help avoid communication mistakes, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed ISO 8601. This standard specifies that all dates should be written in order of most-to-least-significant data. This means the format is year, month, day, hour, minute, and second:\n",

    "\n",
    "Most developers who have worked with time have heard the advice to convert local time to UTC and store that value for later reference. In many cases, especially when you’re storing dates from the past, this is enough information to do any necessary arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a problem can happen if a user of your program inputs a future date in their local time. Time zone and daylight saving time rules change fairly frequently, as you saw earlier with the 2007 change in daylight saving time for the United States and Canada. If the time zone rules for your user’s location change before the future date that they inputted, then UTC won’t provide enough information to convert back to the correct local time.\n",
